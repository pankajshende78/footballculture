<h1>Real Madrid and Juventus have agreed a £105m fee for the transfer.</h1>
<h3>Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus: Why is he leaving Real Madrid?</h3>
<h3>Ultimately, it comes down to him not feeling wanted enough. Ronaldo has spent nine glittering seasons with Madrid and lifted his fourth Champions League trophy in five years just a few weeks ago, but he has a complicated relationship with club president Florentino Perez.

"It's a personal issue," Balague told Sky Sports in Friday's episode of the
 Transfer Talk podcast "Juventus are happy to pay him €30m net per year. 
He would earn the same if he signed a new contract at Real Madrid, but he feels he's not wanted</h3>

<h1>Ryan Giggs denies pressure on Wales to play Gareth Bale against Spain.</h1>
<h3>Ryan Giggs has insisted there is no pressure on Wales to play Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale against Spain</h3>
<h3>Wales will return to the 74,500-capacity Principality Stadium - the home of Welsh rugby - on October 11 for the first time since 2011, with former world and European champions Spain providing high-profile opposition.

The Football Association of Wales reportedly banked close to £1m at the China Cup in March when Bale's involvement prevented any hefty penalty clauses being applied.

<h1>The Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek conundrum: One or the other for Chelsea and England?</h1>
<h3>After Ross Barkley was selected ahead of Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the England squad on Thursday afternoon, it was roles reversed come Thursday evening's Europa League win over Vidi. With places a premium for club and country, the duo's battle has only just begun, writes Michael Hincks.</h3>
<h3>On Wednesday, Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri backed the "improving" Barkley to return to Gareth Southgate's England squad. The midfielder was equally as bullish, stating his performances had warranted a recall.

Come Thursday, the 24-year-old was rewarded with a place in the 25-man squad, ending what has been an 18-month exodus from the national set-up, while you have to go back to May 2016 for the last time he actually featured for England.</h3>
